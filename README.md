## Why CrewForm?

Most multi-agent AI platforms today require you to either:

- 💸 Pay a SaaS provider who marks up your LLM costs
- 🔒 Accept vendor lock-in with no self-hosting option
- 🎓 Be a Python expert to set up orchestration from scratch

**CrewForm changes that.** We provide the orchestration layer — the UI, the team management, the monitoring, the marketplace — while you keep full control of your API keys, your data, and your infrastructure.

CrewForm is built for developers and teams who want production-ready AI agent orchestration without the complexity, cost, or lock-in of closed platforms.

## How CrewForm Compares

CrewForm occupies a unique position: a **UI-first, self-hostable, open-source** multi-agent orchestration platform with zero LLM cost markup.

| Feature | CrewForm | crewAI | AutoGen | LangGraph |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Open Source | ✅ AGPL v3 | ✅ MIT | ✅ CC-BY-4.0 | ✅ MIT |
| Visual UI | ✅ Built-in | ❌ CLI/code only | ❌ Code only | ❌ Code only |
| Self-Hostable | ✅ Docker | N/A (library) | N/A (library) | N/A (library) |
| BYOK (No Markup) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Agent Marketplace | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Team Collaboration | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multi-Provider | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Language | TypeScript | Python | Python | Python |

> **Note:** crewAI, AutoGen, and LangGraph are excellent Python libraries for building agent systems in code. CrewForm is a full-stack platform that wraps similar orchestration capabilities in a deployable application with a UI, team features, and marketplace. They're complementary, not competitors — you could even use crewAI agents inside a CrewForm workflow.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>What is CrewForm?</strong></summary>

CrewForm is an open-source AI orchestration platform that lets you deploy, manage, and collaborate on multi-agent AI workflows through a visual UI — without vendor lock-in or LLM cost markup.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is CrewForm free to use?</strong></summary>

Yes. CrewForm's Community Edition is open-source under the AGPL v3 license. You can self-host it for free. We also offer a hosted version with a free tier at [crewform.tech](https://crewform.tech). Paid plans (Pro $39/mo, Team $99/mo, Enterprise custom) unlock additional features.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the CE/EE split?</strong></summary>

CrewForm uses an open-core model. All code outside `ee/` is Community Edition (AGPL-3.0, free). Code inside `ee/` is Enterprise Edition (proprietary, requires a license key). CE includes agents, pipeline teams, marketplace, and self-hosting. EE adds orchestrator mode, collaboration, memory, audit logs, and more.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What does BYOK mean?</strong></summary>

BYOK stands for **Bring Your Own Key**. You connect your own API keys from providers like Anthropic, Google, or OpenAI. CrewForm never touches your LLM spend — you pay your provider directly at their standard rates.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is CrewForm different from crewAI?</strong></summary>

crewAI is a Python library for orchestrating AI agents in code. CrewForm is a full-stack platform with a visual UI, team collaboration, agent marketplace, and self-hosting support. They solve different problems — crewAI is for developers who want a Python framework, CrewForm is for teams who want a deployable application.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I self-host CrewForm?</strong></summary>

Yes! CrewForm supports Docker-based self-hosting. See our [self-hosting guide](https://docs.crewform.tech/self-hosting) for instructions.

<summary><strong>What LLM providers are supported?</strong></summary>

CrewForm currently supports **Anthropic (Claude)**, **Google (Gemini)**, and **OpenAI (GPT)**. More providers are on the roadmap.
</details>

## License

CrewForm uses a **dual-license** model:

- **Community Edition** (everything outside `ee/`) — [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE)
- **Enterprise Edition** (inside `ee/`) — [CrewForm Enterprise License](ee/LICENSE)

You can use, modify, and distribute the Community Edition freely. Enterprise features require a valid license key. See [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md) for full details.
