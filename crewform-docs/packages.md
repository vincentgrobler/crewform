## Beta Workspaces

Workspaces marked as **beta** retain their current plan tier but receive **unlimited resource usage at no cost**. This means a beta workspace on the Free plan still shows as "Free" but all quota limits (agents, tasks, members, triggers, etc.) are bypassed.

Beta access is granted by CrewForm super admins during early access and launch programs.
