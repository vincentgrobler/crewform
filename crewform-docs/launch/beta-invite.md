# Beta Invite Email Template

**Subject:** You're invited to the CrewForm beta 🚀

Hi {name},

I'm Vincent, the creator of **CrewForm** — an open-source AI orchestration platform that lets you deploy and manage multi-agent workflows through a visual UI.

I'm reaching out because {personalized_reason — e.g., "I saw your work on AI agents and think you'd find this useful" / "you mentioned interest in multi-agent systems"}.

**What CrewForm does:**

- 🤖 Create and configure AI agents from a visual UI (Claude, Gemini, GPT)
- 👥 Chain agents into Pipeline Teams (Research → Write → Edit)
- 🔑 BYOK — use your own API keys, zero markup
- 🏪 Agent Marketplace — share and discover templates
- 🏠 Self-host with Docker or use our hosted version

**What I'm looking for:**

- Try building an agent workflow for your use case
- 10 minutes of feedback on what works and what doesn't
- Feature suggestions for what would make CrewForm indispensable

**Get started:**

1. Sign up at **[crewform.tech](https://crewform.tech)**
2. Add your LLM API key in Settings
3. Create your first agent and run a task

Or self-host: `git clone` → `docker compose up -d`

**Community:** Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NpcWr9d7) for support and to connect with other beta users.

I'd genuinely appreciate any feedback — reply to this email or ping me on Discord. Every piece of input shapes what we build next.

Thanks for considering it!

Vincent
