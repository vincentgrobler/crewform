## First Comment (by maker)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Vincent, the maker of CrewForm. After months of building AI agent workflows in code, I got frustrated with the complexity and cost of existing platforms.

**The problem:** Most multi-agent platforms either charge a markup on your LLM costs, lock you into their infrastructure, or require deep Python expertise to set up.

**CrewForm changes that.** It's a full-stack, open-source platform that gives you:

🤖 **Visual Agent Builder** — Create and configure AI agents from a UI, not code
👥 **Pipeline Teams** — Chain agents together (e.g., Research → Write → Edit)
🔑 **BYOK** — Use your own API keys. Zero markup. Pay your LLM provider directly.
🏪 **Marketplace** — Share and discover agent templates
🏠 **Self-Hostable** — Docker Compose for your own infrastructure
🔒 **Secure** — AES-256-GCM encryption, Row-Level Security

**What we support today:**
- Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), OpenAI (GPT)
- Pipeline team execution with failure handling
- Usage tracking, analytics, and cost monitoring
- REST API for programmatic access

We're launching in beta and would love your feedback. What features would make this most useful for your workflow?
