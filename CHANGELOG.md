# Changelog

All notable changes to CrewForm will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **AG-UI Rich Interactions** — Agents can now pause execution and request user input via three interaction types:
  - **Approval** — Agent asks for permission before proceeding (Approve / Reject buttons)
  - **Data Confirmation** — Agent presents data for user to verify or edit before continuing
  - **Choice Selection** — Agent presents options for the user to pick from
  - New `INTERACTION_REQUEST`, `INTERACTION_RESPONSE`, and `INTERACTION_TIMEOUT` AG-UI event types
  - New `POST /ag-ui/:agentId/respond` endpoint for submitting interaction responses
  - Executor helper functions: `requestApproval()`, `requestDataConfirmation()`, `requestChoice()`
  - `InteractionModal` component with glassmorphism styling, countdown timer, and slide-up animation
  - `useAgentStream` hook now exposes `pendingInteraction` state and `respond()` callback
  - Tasks transition to `waiting_for_input` status while awaiting user response (5-minute default timeout)
  - Migration `069`: `waiting_for_input` task status + `interaction_context` JSONB column

### Changed

- **AG-UI Protocol Version** — Health endpoint now reports version `1.1` (up from `1.0`)

### Documentation

- **Agents Guide** — Added MCP Server Publishing section (publish toggle, tool name mapping, config snippet, client setup)
- **Visual Workflow Builder** — Added Fan-Out Visualization section (fan-out/branch/merge node types, branching pattern, per-branch execution states)
- **AG-UI Protocol** — Added Rich Interactions section (interaction types, `/respond` endpoint, React hook usage, timeout behavior)

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **MCP Server Publishing** — Expose your CrewForm agents as MCP tools so external clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, other agent frameworks) can call them
  - New `mcpServer.ts` handler implementing MCP Streamable HTTP transport (`POST /mcp`)
  - Supports `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, and `ping` JSON-RPC methods
  - Agents opt-in via `is_mcp_published` flag — each published agent becomes an MCP tool with auto-generated name, description, and input schema
  - Auth via dedicated MCP API keys or existing A2A keys (Bearer token)
  - Tasks created with full audit trail and AG-UI event streaming
- **MCP API Key Generation** — Generate, regenerate, and revoke MCP API keys from the Settings UI
  - One-click key generation with `cf_mcp_` prefix
  - Key shown once with copy button; masked preview afterward
  - Regenerate/Revoke actions with confirmation for key rotation
- **MCP Connection Config** — Auto-generated Claude Desktop / Cursor config snippet with copy button in Settings → MCP Servers
- **Ollama Auto-Discovery** — Dynamically detect installed Ollama models via `GET /api/tags` and merge them into the model selector
- **Custom Base URL** — Per-provider base URL field for Ollama (and future providers), enabling remote Ollama instances on different hosts
- **MCP Publish Toggle** — "MCP Publish" / "MCP Published" button on each agent's detail page to opt-in/opt-out of MCP exposure

### Changed

- LLM providers updated from 15 to 16 (Ollama with auto-discovery)
- Task runner now dynamically resolves Ollama base URLs from the API key record instead of hardcoded localhost

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Fan-Out Pipelines** — Pipeline steps can now branch into multiple agents running in parallel, with configurable merge agent and failure modes (`fail_fast` / `continue_on_partial`)
- **Fan-Out Config UI** — New "Add Fan-Out" button in pipeline config panel with multi-agent checklist, merge agent selector, merge instructions, and branch failure mode
- **Fan-Out Canvas Visualization** — Workflow canvas renders fan-out steps as branching nodes with amber-colored edges and merge points
- **Fan-Out Progress Rail** — Real-time execution rail shows parallel branch status indicators per agent
- **Visual Builder Phase 2** — Glassmorphism node styling, live transcript panel, keyboard shortcuts, and tool usage heatmap

- **README Hero GIF** — Animated pipeline run GIF as README hero image

### Fixed

- **Fan-Out Canvas Roundtrip** — Canvas changes no longer destroy fan-out configuration; graph-to-config reverse mapping correctly groups fan-out branch/merge nodes

  - Connect nodes by dragging edges to define pipeline execution order
  - Edit step name, instructions, expected output, and on-failure handling inline on the canvas sidebar
  - Auto-save with validation — invalid configs are rejected with rollback and toast notification

### Added

- **Tier Limits for Knowledge Base** — Free: 3 docs, Pro: 25 docs, Team+: Unlimited. Quota enforced on upload with upgrade prompt
- **Tier Limits for A2A Publishing** — A2A agent publishing gated to Pro+ plans; consuming remains free on all tiers
