## Development Setup

To set up the project locally for development:

1.  **Fork and clone** the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crewform.git
    cd crewform
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies** (for both frontend and the task runner):
    ```bash
    npm install
    cd task-runner && npm install && cd ..
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables**:
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for the frontend and configure the required Supabase credentials and API keys. Do the same for `task-runner` if applicable.

4.  **Start the development servers**:
    ```bash
    # Start the frontend
    npm run dev
    
    # In a separate terminal, start the task runner:
    npm run task-runner:dev # or the relevant start command
    ```

## Project Structure

*   `src/`: Frontend React application built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI.
*   `task-runner/`: Node.js backend execution engine.
*   `supabase/`: Database schema, migrations, and edge functions.
*   `crewform-docs/`: Project documentation and ROADMAP.

## Coding Standards

*   **TypeScript**: Use strictly typed TypeScript. Avoid using `any` wherever possible.
*   **Linting & Formatting**: We use ESLint and Prettier. Ensure your code passes all lint checks (`npm run lint`).
*   **Components**: Follow the established React functional component patterns in `src/components`, keeping components modular and utilizing specialized hooks in `src/hooks`.
